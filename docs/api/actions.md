# Actions

For a complete discovery, strict selection, scroll, assertion, and capture workflow,
see [scoped selection walkthrough](scoped-selection.md).

## Purpose

Define the canonical `ExecutionAction.type` values, the exact parameters each action accepts, which values are validated by Node, and what success and failure data an agent can rely on.

## Sources

- Canonical action types: `apps/node/src/contracts/aliases.ts`
- Shared parameter shape: `apps/node/src/contracts/execution.ts`
- Validation rules: `apps/node/src/domain/executions/validateExecution.ts`
- CLI-built payload defaults: `apps/node/src/domain/actions/` and `apps/node/src/domain/observe/`
- Android payload parsing: `apps/android/shared/data/operator/src/main/kotlin/clawperator/operator/agent/AgentCommandParser.kt`
- Android action/result behavior: `apps/android/shared/data/task/src/main/kotlin/clawperator/task/runner/UiAction.kt` and `UiActionEngine.kt`
- Android text-entry runtime behavior: `apps/android/shared/data/uitree/src/main/kotlin/clawperator/uitree/UiTreeManagerAndroid.kt`

## General Rules

| Rule | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical action names only | Stored payloads should use canonical types such as `open_uri`, `wait_for_node`, and `take_screenshot`. Input aliases are normalized before validation. The on-screen log aliases are exact input values, while their parameter keys remain canonical-only. |
| Canonical payload keys still win | Node accepts common input aliases such as snake_case top-level keys, `package` for `applicationId`, `url` for `uri`, `selector` for `matcher`, and `value` for `text`, but the normalized payload always uses the canonical field names. The on-screen log actions intentionally reject these parameter aliases. |
| `params` is optional at the schema level | Action-specific validation then decides whether it is actually required. |
| Selectors live on a separate page | `matcher`, `container`, `expectedNode`, and `labelMatcher` all use the [Selectors](selectors.md) `NodeMatcher` contract. |
| `StepResult.data` is a string map | Node may attach known keys such as `text`, `path`, `warn`, `application_id`, `error`, or `message`, but most actions do not have a richer static success schema. |
| CLI coverage is narrower than raw JSON | Some advanced fields in `ActionParams` are accepted only through `clawperator exec` JSON, not through flat CLI flags. |
| Runtime details are not always Node guarantees | When this page calls out Android-returned success keys, treat them as current runtime behavior verified from Android code, not as a stricter Node-side schema guarantee. |

## Action receipts and failure evidence

An accepted click, text operation, or scroll dispatch is evidence of the Android
attempt. It does not verify navigation, persisted state, or any application
postcondition. Follow it with a wait, query, read, or snapshot that checks the
specific expected state. A wait for a label already present before the click
cannot prove navigation.

With the v0.10 Operator, selector-targeted click, text, and scroll actions add
these string-valued fields to `data`:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `target` | Serialized [NodeSummary](selectors.md) for the actual dispatch node, from that attempt's capture. Omitted when no target was resolved. |
| `matched_target` | Originally selected NodeSummary when click fallback dispatches to an ancestor or uses a coordinate gesture. |
| `candidate_count` | Base-10 count from the selector resolution used for dispatch. |
| `dispatch_method` | `accessibility_action` for Android accessibility operations (including service text-input APIs), `coordinate_gesture` for a gesture, or `none` before dispatch. |
| `dispatch_accepted` | `"true"` or `"false"`. Gesture acceptance is recorded when Android accepts dispatch, before the asynchronous completion callback. |
| `elapsed_ms` | Base-10 elapsed milliseconds from the Android monotonic clock, including resolution and settling. |

Coordinate clicks report `coordinate` as serialized JSON `{ "x": 100, "y": 200 }`
and omit `target` and `candidate_count`. A failed pre-dispatch action reports
`dispatch_method: "none"` and `dispatch_accepted: "false"`. Receipts do not add a
copy of the entered text. For bounded scroll searches, the receipt describes the
last dispatch; `scrolls_executed` counts the loop's gestures. If the target is
already visible, no dispatch is claimed.

Thrown action failures stop the sequence and retain all completed steps plus
one failed step with its original `id` and `actionType`. Failed-step `errorCode`
and top-level `errorCode` identify the failure; `error` preserves its message.
Command timeout or cancellation retains collected evidence and emits one terminal
result. Cancellation still stops execution. Existing actions that *return* a
failed step continue to subsequent actions; Node still reports the execution as
failed. Returned failed steps add `data.errorCode` while retaining their legacy
`data.error` code. This sequence policy is unchanged.

Missing application hierarchies include serialized `diagnostics` JSON with
`serviceAvailable`, `rootAvailable`, `windowCount`, and `foregroundPackage`.
Unavailable service/window metadata is `null`; a known missing root is `false`.
These observations do not require an application root or select another window.
Raw on-screen log actions remain usable without an application hierarchy.

Migration: receipts require the matching v0.10 Operator. Parse JSON fields
explicitly; `StepResult.data` remains a string map. Coordinate receipt consumers
must parse the new JSON object rather than the older coordinate display string.
Handle the new scroll outcomes below instead of assuming unchanged content is an
edge. No mutation is replayed to obtain a receipt or recover from a failed
post-dispatch observation.

## Retry Object Shape

Several actions accept `retry`, `scrollRetry`, or `clickRetry` objects in raw `clawperator exec` JSON. Node accepts these fields as part of `ActionParams`, and Android parses them into a retry policy with these keys:

```json
{
  "maxAttempts": 4,
  "initialDelayMs": 400,
  "maxDelayMs": 2000,
  "backoffMultiplier": 2,
  "jitterRatio": 0.15
}
```

Meaning:

- `maxAttempts` counts the initial attempt, so `1` means no retry.
- `initialDelayMs` is the delay before the first retry.
- `maxDelayMs` caps exponential backoff growth.
- `backoffMultiplier` must be `>= 1.0`.
- `jitterRatio` must be in `[0.0, 1.0]`.
- Android clamps `maxAttempts` to `1..10`.
- Android clamps `initialDelayMs` to `0..30000`.
- Android clamps `maxDelayMs` to `initialDelayMs..60000`.
- Android clamps `backoffMultiplier` to `1.0..5.0`.
- Android clamps `jitterRatio` to `0.0..1.0`.
- if you omit a retry object, Android applies an action-specific default such as `UiReadiness`, `UiScroll`, `AppLaunch`, `AppClose`, or `None`.

## Canonical Types And Input Aliases

Canonical public action types:

```text
open_app
open_uri
close_app
start_recording
stop_recording
wait_for_node
click
scroll_and_click
scroll
scroll_until
read_text
query_ui
enter_text
snapshot
take_screenshot
sleep
press_key
wait_for_navigation
read_key_value_pair
set_on_screen_log
clear_on_screen_log
```

Input aliases normalized by Node before validation:

| Alias | Canonical type |
| --- | --- |
| `open_url` | `open_uri` |
| `tap` | `click` |
| `press` | `click` |
| `wait_for`, `find`, `find_node` | `wait_for_node` |
| `read` | `read_text` |
| `snapshot_ui` | `snapshot` |
| `screenshot`, `capture_screenshot` | `take_screenshot` |
| `type_text`, `text_entry`, `input_text` | `enter_text` |
| `key_press` | `press_key` |
| `on_screen_log_set` | `set_on_screen_log` |
| `on_screen_log_clear` | `clear_on_screen_log` |

Common payload-key aliases also accepted on input:

- top-level execution keys: `command_id`, `task_id`, `expected_format`, `timeout_ms`
- app/package fields: `package`, `package_id`, `application_id`, `app`, `app_id` -> `applicationId`
- URI field: `url` -> `uri`
- matcher fields: `selector`, `node`, `element` -> `matcher`
- raw matcher-object fields: `id`, `resource_id`, `text`, `text_contains`, `content_desc`, `content_desc_contains`, `description`, `description_contains`, `accessibility_label`, `accessibility_label_contains`
- text-entry field: `value` -> `text`
- screenshot path fields: `file`, `filePath`, `output_path` -> `path`
- navigation fields: `expected_package`, `expected_node`, `timeout_ms`
- open_app fields: `skip_navigation_wait`, `navigation_timeout_ms`
- label selector fields: `label_matcher`, `label_selector`

The on-screen log actions have a deliberately narrow input-alias rule:

- Stored payloads and result `actionType` values use canonical `set_on_screen_log` and `clear_on_screen_log`.
- At the Node input boundary, exact lower-case `on_screen_log_set` and `on_screen_log_clear` normalize to those canonical types before validation and dispatch.
- Case changes and surrounding whitespace are rejected for both canonical types and aliases.
- Their `params` objects accept only the fields documented below and do not translate generic keys such as `value` to `text`.

<a id="action-query-ui"></a>
## `query_ui`

Read-only structured inspection from one fresh Android tree capture. The CLI is
`clawperator query`; the named MCP tool is `query_ui`. All use the Android resolver
shared with existing node-targeted actions.

| Parameter | Default | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `matcher` | omitted | Optional [NodeMatcher](selectors.md); omit to match all eligible nodes. An explicit empty object is invalid. |
| `visibility` | `"on_screen"` | `"on_screen"` or `"all"` |
| `limit` | `100` | Integer from `1` through `1000` |

Queries do not wait for navigation to settle. After a navigation action, use
`clawperator wait` with the expected destination selector (MCP: `wait`; raw:
`wait_for_node`), then query. Zero matches describe that capture only; they do not
prove that a destination has finished loading. A wait is also a separate capture,
so callers must still inspect the subsequent query result.

If Android supplies no hierarchy, the envelope fails with
`errorCode="UI_TREE_UNAVAILABLE"`. Completed steps and the failed `query_ui` step
are retained, and later actions do not run. Failed-step data contains `errorCode`,
a human-readable `error`, and serialized JSON `diagnostics` with
`serviceAvailable`, `rootAvailable`, `windowCount`, and `foregroundPackage`.
Unknown facts are `null`; `rootAvailable` is `false` for the failed capture.
No `data.query` is emitted. A screenshot can remain available when accessibility
hierarchy access is unavailable. This error does not identify the platform cause
or promise that retrying will expose a restricted screen. Named MCP returns the
same error code and envelope.

Zero, one, or multiple matches all succeed. `data.query` is a serialized JSON
string with this shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "snapshotId": "observation-local-id",
  "capturedAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "totalMatches": 1,
  "returnedCount": 1,
  "truncated": false,
  "nodes": [{
    "nodePath": "0.2",
    "parentPath": "0",
    "resourceId": "example:id/switch",
    "className": "android.widget.Switch",
    "role": "switch",
    "label": "",
    "contentDescription": null,
    "bounds": {"left": 10, "top": 30, "right": 110, "bottom": 130},
    "visibleToUser": true,
    "onScreen": true,
    "enabled": true,
    "clickable": true,
    "checkable": true,
    "checked": false,
    "selected": false,
    "scrollable": false,
    "accessibilityDataSensitive": false
  }]
}
```

`totalMatches` counts nodes before the limit, including nodes with blank labels.
`returnedCount` is the array length. `truncated` means the limit omitted whole
nodes. Unavailable state stays `null`, distinct from `false`. `clickable` reports
the platform node's clickability when captured, rather than inherited ancestor
clickability used by legacy action dispatch.

`accessibilityDataSensitive` reports Android's per-node accessibility-data flag
at capture time. The flag is available on Android 14 (API 34) and later:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | Android reports the node's accessibility data as sensitive. |
| `false` | Android reports the node's accessibility data as non-sensitive. |
| `null` | The device runs an earlier Android version, the node is a fallback, or the flag could not be read. |

Queries emit this field even when it is null. When consuming a payload with the
field absent, treat it as unknown. Queries and XML capture do not require API 34;
only this flag does. A filtered query reports only its returned nodes, so use an
unfiltered query to inspect root sensitivity.

Raw XML emits `accessibility-data-sensitive="true"` or `"false"` when known,
and omits the attribute when unknown. XML and queries capture independently;
compare stable fixture nodes, not observation paths. Sensitivity does not change
matching, success, redaction, or export behavior. It does not establish private
browsing, screenshot protection, password status, or whether content is safe to
share. Verify browser-mode indicators and behavior separately.

Nodes are in preorder. Paths use child indices in the captured `UiNode` tree,
rooted at `"0"`, and retain their original indices across visibility filtering.
The root's `parentPath` is `null`. Paths and snapshot IDs are observation-local;
they are neither stable cross-capture IDs nor valid action targets. `capturedAt`
is the APK's UTC timestamp immediately after tree capture. XML is a separate
capture with no guaranteed shared node identity.

`visibleToUser` is the platform flag. `onScreen` follows the existing action
eligibility rule: positive normalized bounds, platform visibility, screen
intersection, and ancestor pruning. The existing root-retention exception remains:
the root is retained even when ineligible, with its descendants pruned. Neither
flag proves visual non-occlusion. `all` includes offscreen and hidden captured
nodes; their `onScreen` value still reports the same action eligibility.

A UTF-8 `data.query` payload above 256 KiB fails with `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`; JSON is
never cut to fit. Reduce `limit` or narrow the matcher. This response guard is
separate from the execution request size limit. Raw XML snapshots remain
available and add `visible-to-user` without restructuring the hierarchy.

```bash
clawperator query --device <device_serial> --operator-package com.clawperator.operator.dev --visibility all --limit 100
clawperator query --matcher-json '{"descendant":{"textEquals":"Display"}}'
```

### Runnable Node consumer

From a repository checkout, build and run the tested
[query consumer example](https://github.com/clawperator/clawperator/blob/main/apps/node/src/examples/query-consumer.ts):

```bash
npm --prefix apps/node ci
npm --prefix apps/node run build
node apps/node/dist/examples/query-consumer.js --device <device_serial> --operator-package com.clawperator.operator.dev --visibility all --limit 1000
```

The example invokes the CLI built in that checkout. It accepts query flags and
omits the matcher by default for all-node discovery. An explicit
`--matcher-json '{}'` (or `--selector '{}'`) is invalid; remove that flag and its
value to discover all eligible nodes. Other node-targeted actions still require
an appropriate [selector](selectors.md).

Before returning an inventory, the consumer checks the process exit, signal and
spawn error; canonical terminal evidence; successful envelope and every step;
and exactly one `query_ui` step with ID `query`. It parses that step's string
`data.query`, validates schema version 1 and node field types, checks count
consistency, and rejects truncation. `consumeQuery(output, queryStepId)` can
select an explicitly named step when adapting the local example to a multi-step
response. It is example-local validation, not an exported SDK accessor.

Success prints `commandId`, `taskId`, the decoded `query`, and the original
process output in `diagnostics`. Failure exits with code 1 and prints a message
and the original output to stderr, including any available envelope and IDs.
Preserve those diagnostics when investigating failures. Unknown nullable states
remain null; an omitted `accessibilityDataSensitive` remains unknown.

To observe refusal of a partial inventory on a screen with multiple nodes:

```bash
node apps/node/dist/examples/query-consumer.js --device <device_serial> --operator-package com.clawperator.operator.dev --visibility all --limit 1
```

A truncated inventory cannot prove absence or uniqueness. Increase the limit
(up to 1000) or narrow the matcher, recognizing that a filtered result only
covers that filter. Even a complete result describes one capture and its
visibility scope, not future state or completion of navigation. Zero matches
are valid for that capture. The original response remains available on both
success and failure; the canonical envelope and string payload are unchanged.

`--matcher-json` and `--selector` name the same JSON input and are mutually
exclusive with simple selector flags (`--text`, `--text-contains`, `--id`, `--desc`,
`--desc-contains`, `--role`). Omitting all selector flags matches all eligible nodes.

## Full Payload Example

```json
{
  "commandId": "open-settings-and-snapshot",
  "taskId": "open-settings-and-snapshot",
  "source": "agent-loop",
  "expectedFormat": "android-ui-automator",
  "timeoutMs": 30000,
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "open-1",
      "type": "open_app",
      "params": {
        "applicationId": "com.android.settings"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "wait-1",
      "type": "wait_for_navigation",
      "params": {
        "expectedPackage": "com.android.settings",
        "timeoutMs": 5000
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "snap-1",
      "type": "snapshot"
    }
  ],
  "mode": "direct"
}
```

Success condition for that payload:

- `envelope.status == "success"`
- every `envelope.stepResults[i].success == true`
- `envelope.stepResults[2].actionType == "snapshot"`
- `"text" in envelope.stepResults[2].data`

## Action Reference

Non-strict first-match selection adds `data.selection_warning` when duplicate
candidates are observed, with a hint to use `--strict` (`params.strict=true`).
This advisory field does not change action success. See
[duplicate-selection hints](selectors.md#duplicate-selection-hints).

All node-targeted actions below support optional boolean `params.strict` and an
optional `params.container` matcher: `click`, `enter_text`, `read_text`,
`wait_for_node`, `scroll`, `scroll_until`, and `scroll_and_click`. See
[strict selection](selectors.md#strict-action-selection) for action-specific
absence, ambiguity, container, and compatibility rules. Coordinate clicks cannot
use strict mode or a container. Strict failures return string-valued
`data.error`, `data.candidate_count`, and serialized JSON in `data.candidates`.

<a id="action-click"></a>
### `click`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | exactly one of `params.matcher` or `params.coordinate` |
| `matcher` | any non-empty `NodeMatcher` |
| `coordinate` | `{ "x": <int >= 0>, "y": <int >= 0> }` |
| `clickType` | optional string; CLI builders use `"default"`, `"long_click"`, or `"focus"` |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `UiReadiness` |

Rules:

- `matcher` and `coordinate` are mutually exclusive.
- `clickType = "focus"` is invalid with `coordinate`.
- CLI defaults to `"default"` and omits the field from the payload.

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for missing selector, dual selector modes, invalid coordinates, or unsupported `clickType` combinations
- runtime step failures such as `NODE_NOT_FOUND`, `NODE_NOT_CLICKABLE`, `GESTURE_FAILED`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "click-1",
  "type": "click",
  "params": {
    "matcher": { "textEquals": "Settings" },
    "clickType": "long_click"
  }
}
```

<a id="action-scroll"></a>
### `scroll`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | none |
| `direction` | optional string in `down`, `up`, `left`, `right` |
| `container` | optional `NodeMatcher` |
| `distanceRatio` | optional number in `[0.0, 1.0]` |
| `settleDelayMs` | optional number in `[0, 10000]` |
| `findFirstScrollableChild` | optional boolean in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `true` |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `None` for plain scroll |

Semantics:

- if `direction` is omitted in raw JSON, Node validation allows omission
- Android defaults omitted `direction` to `down`
- the flat CLI always sets a direction explicitly
- `container` scopes the scroll to a matched scrollable container
- `distanceRatio` and `settleDelayMs` are advanced tuning fields for raw JSON execution
- if `findFirstScrollableChild == true` and the matched container is not itself scrollable, Android walks down to the first scrollable descendant; strict mode requires that eligible descendant to be unique
- `retry` covers pre-dispatch container resolution; an exception after dispatch does not replay the gesture

Success and progress data:

- `scroll_outcome`, `direction`, `distance_ratio`, `settle_delay_ms`, and optional
  `resolved_container` retain their existing names; dispatch receipts are described above.
- `progress` is serialized JSON with `beforeSignature`, `afterSignature`,
  `comparable`, and `reason`. Available signatures are bounded SHA-256 hashes;
  raw node text is not included. Missing signatures are `null`.
- Comparison re-resolves the same scoped container. Ambiguous or changed identity
  is not comparable, even if the screen appears to have moved. A container that
  remains identifiable but stops reporting `scrollable` can still produce
  comparable progress; eligibility loss alone is not `container_lost`.

| `scroll_outcome` | Observation | Step success |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `moved` | Comparable signatures changed | `true` |
| `no_movement` | Comparable signatures are unchanged | `true` |
| `unknown` | Missing signatures or an ambiguous/incomparable container | `true` |
| `container_lost` | Container or hierarchy disappeared after the gesture | `false` |
| `gesture_failed` | Gesture was rejected or did not complete successfully | `false` |
| `edge_reached` | Reserved for explicitly instrumented platform boundary evidence; the current runtime does not emit it | n/a |

An accepted gesture may later be cancelled by Android. In that case
`dispatch_accepted` remains `"true"`, while `scroll_outcome` is `gesture_failed`.
Neither `no_movement` nor `unknown` proves the container is at an edge.

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for invalid `direction`, `distanceRatio`, or `settleDelayMs`
- runtime step failures such as `CONTAINER_NOT_FOUND`, `CONTAINER_NOT_SCROLLABLE`, `GESTURE_FAILED`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "scroll-1",
  "type": "scroll",
  "params": {
    "direction": "down",
    "container": { "resourceId": "android:id/list" },
    "distanceRatio": 0.7,
    "settleDelayMs": 250
  }
}
```

<a id="action-scroll-until"></a>
### `scroll_until`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | none at schema level; `matcher` becomes required when `clickAfter == true` |
| `direction` | optional string in `down`, `up`, `left`, `right` |
| `matcher` | optional `NodeMatcher` |
| `container` | optional `NodeMatcher` |
| `clickAfter` | optional boolean |
| `distanceRatio` | optional number in `[0.0, 1.0]` |
| `settleDelayMs` | optional number in `[0, 10000]` |
| `maxScrolls` | optional integer in `[1, 200]` |
| `maxDurationMs` | optional number in `[0, 120000]` |
| `noPositionChangeThreshold` | optional integer in `[1, 20]` |
| `findFirstScrollableChild` | optional boolean in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `true` |
| `clickType` | optional string in raw `exec` JSON; Android parses the same click types used by `click` |

Semantics:

- without `clickAfter`, the action scrolls until the target becomes visible or the loop terminates
- with `clickAfter: true`, the same action requires `matcher` and turns into “scroll then click”
- the flat CLI exposes only the core controls; advanced tuning requires raw JSON via `clawperator exec`
- Android defaults omitted `direction` to `down`, `distanceRatio` to `0.7`, `settleDelayMs` to `250`, `maxScrolls` to `20`, `maxDurationMs` to `10000`, `noPositionChangeThreshold` to `3`, and `findFirstScrollableChild` to `true`
- `maxScrolls` is the hard cap on how many scroll steps Android will attempt
- `maxDurationMs` is checked against monotonic elapsed time before each gesture; the current gesture and bounded settle/target checks may finish after that threshold, while the command timeout cancels execution
- `noPositionChangeThreshold` stops the loop after that many consecutive `no_movement`, signature-only `unknown`, or rejected gestures; loss of the original container identity terminates with `CONTAINER_LOST`
- after choosing a scroll container, target observations and the requested click stay within that original container's descendants, including for legacy unscoped searches; an exhausted search cannot be changed to success by a target outside that scope
- an identifiable container that stops reporting `scrollable` still allows a revealed target to satisfy the search and the requested click to run once; if the target remains absent after bounded observation, the search terminates with `CONTAINER_NOT_SCROLLABLE` without scrolling a different container
- initially visible targets retain legacy unscoped matching when neither strict selection nor a container is requested

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for invalid direction or out-of-range tuning fields
- runtime step failures such as `NODE_NOT_FOUND`, `CONTAINER_NOT_FOUND`, `CONTAINER_NOT_SCROLLABLE`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "scroll-until-1",
  "type": "scroll_until",
  "params": {
    "direction": "down",
    "matcher": { "textEquals": "About phone" },
    "maxScrolls": 25,
    "maxDurationMs": 10000,
    "noPositionChangeThreshold": 3
  }
}
```

<a id="action-scroll-and-click"></a>
### `scroll_and_click`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `matcher` |
| `direction` | optional string in `down`, `up`, `left`, `right` |
| `matcher` | required `NodeMatcher` |
| `container` | optional `NodeMatcher` |
| `clickAfter` | optional boolean in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults it to `true` |
| `maxSwipes` | optional integer in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults it to `10` and clamps it to `[1, 50]` |
| `distanceRatio` | optional number in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults it to `0.7` and clamps it to `[0.0, 1.0]` |
| `settleDelayMs` | optional number in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults it to `250` and clamps it to `[0, 10000]` |
| `findFirstScrollableChild` | optional boolean in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults it to `true` |
| `clickType` | optional string in raw `exec` JSON; Android parses the same click types used by `click` |
| `scrollRetry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `UiScroll` |
| `clickRetry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `UiReadiness` |

Semantics:

- this is the canonical action type produced by `scroll-until --click` and `scroll-and-click`
- unlike raw `scroll_until`, this action is optimized for “scroll to target, then click target”
- `maxSwipes` is the safety cap on how many swipes Android performs before failing
- scroll and view refresh remain bounded by `maxSwipes`; mutations are not replayed after a post-dispatch failure
- target observation, eligibility transitions, and final click scoping follow the same rules as [`scroll_until`](#action-scroll-until)
- `clickRetry` applies only to the final click after the target is visible
- setting `clickAfter: false` is accepted in raw `exec` JSON and makes Android stop after revealing the target, but the flat CLI does not emit that variant for `scroll_and_click`

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` if `matcher` is absent
- runtime scroll or click failures, including `NODE_NOT_FOUND`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "scroll-click-1",
  "type": "scroll_and_click",
  "params": {
    "matcher": { "textEquals": "Submit" },
    "direction": "down"
  }
}
```

<a id="action-read-text"></a>
### `read_text`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `matcher` |
| `matcher` | required `NodeMatcher` |
| `all` | optional boolean; when `true`, request all matches instead of the first match |
| `container` | optional `NodeMatcher` |
| `validator` | optional string; current validation adds special behavior only for `"regex"` |
| `validatorPattern` | required non-empty valid regex string when `validator == "regex"` |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `UiReadiness` |

Semantics:

- if `validator` is omitted, no validator-specific Node rule runs
- if `validator == "regex"`, `validatorPattern` must exist and compile as a regex
- other validator strings are accepted by the current Node schema, but this repo does not add extra Node-side validation semantics for them
- current Android parser accepts only `temperature`, `version`, and `regex`; any other validator string is rejected at runtime
- `all: true` asks Android to return all matching text values instead of only the first match

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for missing `matcher` or invalid regex configuration
- runtime failures such as `NODE_NOT_FOUND`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "read-1",
  "type": "read_text",
  "params": {
    "matcher": { "textContains": "Order" },
    "validator": "regex",
    "validatorPattern": "^ORD-[0-9]{6}$",
    "all": false
  }
}
```

<a id="action-read-key-value-pair"></a>
### `read_key_value_pair`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `labelMatcher` |
| `labelMatcher` | required `NodeMatcher` |
| `all` | optional boolean |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `UiReadiness` |

Semantics:

- built by the flat `read-value` CLI command
- uses a label matcher rather than a generic element matcher

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` when `labelMatcher` is absent

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "read-value-1",
  "type": "read_key_value_pair",
  "params": {
    "labelMatcher": { "textEquals": "Battery" },
    "all": false
  }
}
```

<a id="action-enter-text"></a>
### `enter_text`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `matcher`, `text` |
| `matcher` | required `NodeMatcher` |
| `text` | required non-empty string |
| `clear` | optional boolean |
| `submit` | optional boolean |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `UiReadiness` |

Semantics:

- `submit` defaults to `false` in the built-in CLI builders
- `clear` defaults to `false` in the built-in CLI builders
- Android uses an internal first-match-wins text-entry ladder while keeping the public `enter_text` shape unchanged
- Android prefers the editable node `ACTION_SET_TEXT` route when it is available because that path already matches current replace-text semantics
- on that `ACTION_SET_TEXT` route, `clear == true` first dispatches `ACTION_SET_TEXT("")`, then dispatches `ACTION_SET_TEXT` with the requested `text`
- on that same `ACTION_SET_TEXT` route, `clear == false` or omitted keeps the existing single `ACTION_SET_TEXT` behavior
- if the requested clear step fails on the `ACTION_SET_TEXT` route, Android stops before the real text set for that legacy strategy; on Android 13+ it can still continue to the accessibility input-connection fallback when that route is available, otherwise the action fails
- on Android 13+ (`Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU`) when the legacy `ACTION_SET_TEXT` route is unavailable or does not complete successfully, Android can fall back to the accessibility input-connection path for custom editors
- that API 33 fallback still preserves replace-style behavior by moving the cursor to the end, deleting preceding text, then committing the replacement text
- that API 33 replace sequence also preserves `clear == true` semantics even though there is no separate public strategy flag
- `submit == true` is best effort after successful text entry
- on the legacy route, Android prefers `ACTION_IME_ENTER` when the node exposes it and falls back to a click when it does not
- on the API 33 input-connection route, Android prefers `performEditorAction(...)`
- if text entry succeeds but no truthful submit action is available, the step still succeeds and `submit` does not become a new hard-failure condition

Success data:

- Node does not declare a richer static schema here
- current Android runtime behavior returns `data.text`, `data.clear`, and `data.submit`

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for missing matcher or blank text
- runtime failures such as `NODE_NOT_FOUND`
- Android task-status failure payloads use `failure_point = set_text_failed` when the clear or text-set step cannot be completed

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "type-1",
  "type": "enter_text",
  "params": {
    "matcher": { "resourceId": "com.example:id/search" },
    "text": "hello world",
    "clear": true,
    "submit": false
  }
}
```

Verification pattern:

```bash
clawperator type "battery" --id "com.android.settings:id/search_src_text" --clear
```

Success conditions:

- exit code `0`
- `envelope.status == "success"`
- `envelope.stepResults[0].actionType == "enter_text"`
- `envelope.stepResults[0].success == true`
- `envelope.stepResults[0].data.clear == "true"`

Android live-route verification:

- when validating against the debug operator on device, operator logs include
  `enter_text strategy=<strategy_name> submit_method=<submit_method>`
- on the API 33 route, warning-level logs can also include
  `enter_text strategy=api33_input_connection partial_failure reason=<reason>`
  when the fallback delete step succeeds but the final `commitText(...)` does
  not
- current shipped strategy names are `legacy_action_set_text` and
  `api33_input_connection`

<a id="action-press-key"></a>
### `press_key`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `key` |
| `key` | case-insensitive string in `back`, `home`, `recents` |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `None` |

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for missing or unsupported key

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "press-1",
  "type": "press_key",
  "params": {
    "key": "back"
  }
}
```

<a id="action-wait-for-node"></a>
### `wait_for_node`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `matcher` |
| `matcher` | required `NodeMatcher` |
| `timeoutMs` | optional number; the current Android parser clamps a provided value to `1..120000`; when built by the CLI, it comes from `--timeout` |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `UiReadiness` |

Semantics:

- the action-level `timeoutMs` is distinct from the execution-level `timeoutMs`
- current Node validation does not add a stricter positivity check for this field
- the builder inflates the execution timeout to `max(actionTimeout + 5000, 30000)` so the envelope does not expire before the wait finishes

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` when `matcher` is missing
- runtime failure when the target never appears

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "wait-1",
  "type": "wait_for_node",
  "params": {
    "matcher": { "textEquals": "Settings" },
    "timeoutMs": 5000
  }
}
```

<a id="action-wait-for-navigation"></a>
### `wait_for_navigation`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | at least one of `expectedPackage` or `expectedNode`, plus `timeoutMs` |
| `expectedPackage` | optional non-empty string up to matcher-length limits |
| `expectedNode` | optional `NodeMatcher` |
| `timeoutMs` | required number in `(0, 30000]` |

Semantics:

- at least one navigation target must be present
- the CLI builder inflates execution timeout to `max(timeoutMs + 5000, 30000)`

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for missing target, missing timeout, or timeout above `30000`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "wait-nav-1",
  "type": "wait_for_navigation",
  "params": {
    "expectedPackage": "com.android.settings",
    "timeoutMs": 5000
  }
}
```

<a id="action-snapshot"></a>
### `snapshot`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | none |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `UiReadiness` |

Semantics:

- the old `format` parameter is explicitly rejected as removed
- built-in builders set execution timeout to `30000` unless overridden
- snapshot extraction requires the `[TaskScope] UI Hierarchy [commandId=<command_id>]:` marker; see [Snapshot Format](snapshot.md)

Success data:

- `data.text` contains the extracted XML hierarchy
- `data.warn` may be added when a snapshot immediately follows `click` or `scroll_and_click` without an intervening sleep

Common failures:

- `SNAPSHOT_EXTRACTION_FAILED`
- `RESULT_ENVELOPE_TIMEOUT`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "snap-1",
  "type": "snapshot"
}
```

<a id="action-set-on-screen-log"></a>
### `set_on_screen_log`

Use this raw action to show one noninteractive diagnostic panel owned by the connected Operator accessibility service. Supply literal `text` or a live Android-resolved `template`. CLI conveniences are `on-screen-log set --text <text>` and `on-screen-log set --template <template>`. See [On-screen logs](on-screen-logs.md) for lifecycle, capture, and transport details.

| Field | Valid values | Default / meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Required | Exactly one of `text` or `template` | Literal label or live metadata template. |
| `text` | String with `1..2048` UTF-16 code units, at least one non-whitespace character | Literal text. LF and TAB are allowed; other control characters are rejected. |
| `template` | Same input bounds as `text`; only the nine documented placeholders | See [template vocabulary, escaping and expansion bounds](on-screen-logs.md#live-templates). Mutually exclusive with `text`. |
| `anchor` | Exact `left` or `right` | `left`; physical display edge. |
| `textAlign` | Exact `left` or `right` | `left`; alignment inside the panel. |
| `topOffsetDp` | Integer-valued JSON number `0..1000` | `8`; from the usable top edge. |
| `edgeOffsetDp` | Integer-valued JSON number `0..1000` | `8`; inward from the selected usable horizontal edge. |
| `widthDp` | Integer-valued JSON number `80..600` | `280`; full panel width including padding. |
| `fontSizeSp` | Integer-valued JSON number `8..24` | `12`; follows Android font scale. |
| `textColor` | Exact `#RRGGBB` or `#AARRGGBB` | `#FFFFFFFF`. |
| `backgroundColor` | Exact `#RRGGBB` or `#AARRGGBB` | `#B3000000`. |
| `ttlMs` | Integer-valued JSON number `1000..3600000` | `300000`; local stale-label expiry. |

Rules:

- only the fields in this table are accepted
- do not use named colors, fractional numbers, numeric strings, `null`, parameter aliases, or unknown keys
- six-digit colors normalize to uppercase opaque eight-digit colors, for example `#a1b2c3` becomes `#FFA1B2C3`
- every successful set replaces the whole existing panel using supplied values and defaults, rather than patching existing state
- malformed input is rejected before dispatch and cannot modify a currently visible panel

Success data has the exact string-valued keys `visible`, `rendered`, `truncated`, `anchor`, `text_align`, `top_offset_dp`, `edge_offset_dp`, `width_dp`, `font_size_sp`, `text_color`, `background_color`, `ttl_ms`, and `bounds`. The result does not echo caller text or resolved metadata. Bounds and truncation describe the initial draw; live refreshes preserve the original TTL.

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` before dispatch for malformed raw input
- `ON_SCREEN_LOG_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, `ON_SCREEN_LOG_LAYOUT_INVALID`, `ON_SCREEN_LOG_RENDER_FAILED`, or `ON_SCREEN_LOG_RENDER_TIMEOUT` from the runtime

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "set-panel",
  "type": "set_on_screen_log",
  "params": {
    "text": "FLOW-001: Observe settings",
    "anchor": "right",
    "textAlign": "left",
    "topOffsetDp": 0,
    "edgeOffsetDp": 12,
    "widthDp": 320,
    "fontSizeSp": 16,
    "textColor": "#a1b2c3",
    "backgroundColor": "#7f0a0b0c",
    "ttlMs": 12000
  }
}
```

<a id="action-clear-on-screen-log"></a>
### `clear_on_screen_log`

Remove the current Operator-owned on-screen log panel. It accepts omitted `params` or exactly `{}`. Any other value, including `null` or a nonempty object, is rejected.

Success data is exactly:

```json
{
  "visible": "false"
}
```

Clear succeeds while the panel is already hidden. It does not include a `rendered` field.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "clear-panel",
  "type": "clear_on_screen_log",
  "params": {}
}
```

<a id="action-take-screenshot"></a>
### `take_screenshot`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | none |
| `path` | optional non-empty string |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `None` |

Semantics:

- if `path` is present, it must not be blank
- built-in builders set execution timeout to `30000` unless overridden

Success data:

- `data.path` after Node finalizes the screenshot capture

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for blank path
- timeout or runtime screenshot capture failures

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "shot-1",
  "type": "take_screenshot",
  "params": {
    "path": "/tmp/settings.png"
  }
}
```

<a id="action-close-app"></a>
### `close_app`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `applicationId` |
| `applicationId` | required non-empty package id string |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `AppClose` |

Semantics:

- built-in builders default execution timeout to `30000`
- Node runs a pre-flight adb force-stop and may normalize an Android-side unsupported close into success

Success data:

- `data.application_id` when pre-flight close succeeded

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for missing `applicationId`
- adb force-stop failure or package/runtime failures

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "close-1",
  "type": "close_app",
  "params": {
    "applicationId": "com.android.settings"
  }
}
```

<a id="action-sleep"></a>
### `sleep`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `durationMs` |
| `durationMs` | required number `>= 0` and `<=` the maximum execution timeout constant |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `None` |

Semantics:

- builder sets execution timeout to `max(durationMs + 5000, globalTimeout, 30000)`

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for negative or oversized duration

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "sleep-1",
  "type": "sleep",
  "params": {
    "durationMs": 1500
  }
}
```

<a id="action-open-app"></a>
### `open_app`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `applicationId` |
| `applicationId` | required non-empty package id string |
| `skipNavigationWait` | optional boolean, defaults to `false` |
| `navigationTimeoutMs` | optional integer in `[1000, 120000]`, defaults to `15000` |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `AppLaunch` |

Semantics:

- `open_app` dispatches the launch intent, then waits until the launched package is the active foreground accessibility package before returning success.
- set `skipNavigationWait: true` only when you intentionally want the older fire-and-forget behavior.
- `navigationTimeoutMs` controls the readiness wait only. It does not change the execution-level timeout.
- already-foreground launches succeed without a package-transition race.
- callers that need content to be present after the package is foreground should follow with `wait_for_node`.
- the `clawperator open` CLI exposes `--skip-navigation-wait` and `--navigation-timeout-ms` for package targets only; URI targets reject both flags with `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED`.

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for missing `applicationId`
- runtime step failures such as `NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT` when the launched package does not reach the foreground within the wait budget

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "open-1",
  "type": "open_app",
  "params": {
    "applicationId": "com.android.settings",
    "skipNavigationWait": false,
    "navigationTimeoutMs": 15000
  }
}
```

<a id="action-open-uri"></a>
### `open_uri`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | `uri` |
| `uri` | required non-empty string, max length enforced by `MAX_URI_LENGTH` |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `AppLaunch` |

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for missing or blank `uri`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "open-uri-1",
  "type": "open_uri",
  "params": {
    "uri": "https://clawperator.com"
  }
}
```

<a id="action-start-recording"></a>
### `start_recording`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | none |
| `sessionId` | optional non-blank string |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `None` |

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for blank `sessionId`
- recording-state runtime errors such as `RECORDING_ALREADY_IN_PROGRESS`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "record-start-1",
  "type": "start_recording",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "session-001"
  }
}
```

<a id="action-stop-recording"></a>
### `stop_recording`

| Field | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| Required | none |
| `sessionId` | optional non-blank string |
| `retry` | optional retry object in raw `exec` JSON; Android defaults to `None` |

Success data:

- no Node-guaranteed success keys

Common failures:

- `EXECUTION_VALIDATION_FAILED` for blank `sessionId`
- recording-state runtime errors such as `RECORDING_NOT_IN_PROGRESS`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "record-stop-1",
  "type": "stop_recording",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "session-001"
  }
}
```

## CLI To Action Mapping

| CLI command | Canonical action type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `click` | `click` | `tap` is a CLI synonym |
| `type` | `enter_text` | built from selector + text |
| `read` | `read_text` | supports optional container matcher |
| `read-value` | `read_key_value_pair` | built from label selector flags |
| `wait` | `wait_for_node` | action timeout comes from `--timeout` |
| `wait-for-nav` | `wait_for_navigation` | requires `--timeout` |
| `snapshot` | `snapshot` | no action params |
| `screenshot` | `take_screenshot` | optional `path` |
| `close` | `close_app` | `close-app` is a CLI synonym |
| `sleep` | `sleep` | duration is positional |
| `open` | `open_app` or `open_uri` | dispatch depends on target string |
| `press`, `back` | `press_key` | `back` hardcodes `key = "back"` |
| `scroll` | `scroll` | container flags optional |
| `scroll-until` | `scroll_until` or `scroll_and_click` | `--click` switches to `scroll_and_click` |
| `scroll-and-click` | `scroll_and_click` | alias that implies click-after |

`on-screen-log set --text <text>` and `on-screen-log clear` map to `set_on_screen_log` and `clear_on_screen_log`. See [On-screen logs](on-screen-logs.md#cli-commands) for the flags and separate-execution capture sequence. Raw `clawperator exec` and existing generic execute transports remain supported.

## Result Data You Can Rely On

| Action type | Success keys exposed by the current execution runtime |
| --- | --- |
| `snapshot` | `data.text`; optional `data.warn` |
| `take_screenshot` | `data.path` |
| `close_app` | `data.application_id` when Node pre-flight succeeded |
| `set_on_screen_log` | `visible`, `rendered`, `truncated`, normalized style values, and `bounds`; all values are strings and caller text is omitted |
| `clear_on_screen_log` | `visible` with value `"false"` |
| all others | no fixed success keys guaranteed by Node |

Concrete success example for `take_screenshot`:

```json
{
  "id": "shot-1",
  "actionType": "take_screenshot",
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "path": "/tmp/settings.png"
  }
}
```

Concrete success example for `snapshot`:

```json
{
  "id": "snap-1",
  "actionType": "snapshot",
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "text": "<hierarchy rotation=\"0\">...</hierarchy>",
    "warn": "snapshot captured without a preceding sleep step; UI may not have settled - consider adding a sleep step between click and snapshot"
  }
}
```

For failures, inspect:

- `envelope.status`
- first failed `stepResults[i].success == false`
- `stepResults[i].data.error`
- `stepResults[i].data.message`

## Notification and media actions

See [notifications](notifications.md) for list_notifications, dismiss_notification and invoke_notification_action; see
[media sessions](media.md) for list_media_sessions, get_media_status, media_pause,
media_play and media_seek. These share canonical execution and result correlation across CLI,
HTTP and MCP. Nonempty lists containing only notification/media reads and media pause/play/seek
bypass interactive readiness without waking the device. Notification mutations
and UI-containing lists retain whole-execution interactive readiness.
