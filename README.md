# Clawperator

Clawperator ("Claw Operator") is a deterministic Android automation runtime for AI agents. It is the actuator layer: the external agent or LLM owns reasoning and planning, and Clawperator executes validated Android actions on behalf of a user.

## Why Clawperator?

Many consumer services only expose critical data in mobile apps, not public web APIs.

Examples include:
- Family tracking/location apps
- Home automation apps
- Grocery/shopping apps
- Ride-hailing apps

Clawperator lets AI agents interact with these apps on your behalf. Its API is predictable and stable, so skills can be created, reused, and shared.

## What is Clawperator?

Clawperator is the execution layer for LLM-driven Android automation. It provides a deterministic Node.js CLI and HTTP API - the "hand" for an LLM "brain."

**What agents can do:**
- Connect to a real Android device
- Run deterministic UI actions (tap, scroll, type, read)
- Observe screen state via structured snapshots
- Get canonical terminal results (`[Clawperator-Result]`)
- Compose primitives into repeatable skills

**Design principles:**
- **Deterministic:** Strict contracts, no hidden retries, one result envelope per command
- **Observable:** Structured UI snapshots and machine-readable error codes
- **Agent-first:** JSON output, typed errors, single-flight concurrency

**Typical setup:** A dedicated Android device (any cheap/old phone) stays connected to your agent's host machine as a permanent actuator. The agent sends commands via the Clawperator API; Clawperator executes and reports results.


## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawperator.com/install.sh | bash
```

The installer:
- installs or upgrades the CLI prerequisites
- downloads the current stable operator APK via `latest.json`
- verifies the APK checksum
- offers to install the APK to a single connected Android device, even when run via `curl ... | bash`

Or install the CLI directly:

```bash
npm install -g clawperator
```

## Quick Start

```bash
clawperator doctor                              # Verify setup
clawperator devices --json                      # List connected devices
clawperator snapshot --device <device_id> --json   # Capture UI tree
clawperator exec payload.json --device <device_id>   # Run an execution (`execute` synonym; `--payload` / `--execution` optional)
```

CLI device commands are flat (`snapshot`, `screenshot`, `click`, `open`, `type`, ...). When several devices are connected, pass `--device` (alias: `--device-id`). See [API Overview](docs/api/overview.md) for flags, HTTP routes, and error codes.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- `adb` in PATH
- Android device with USB debugging enabled
- Clawperator APK installed ([stable download](https://clawperator.com/operator.apk), [historical releases](https://github.com/clawperator/clawperator/releases))

## For AI Agents

Clawperator is an actuator, not an autonomous planner. Use these entrypoints first:

- [Agent Quickstart](https://docs.clawperator.com/ai-agents/agent-quickstart/) - fastest path from install to first successful execution
- [Node API for Agents](https://docs.clawperator.com/ai-agents/node-api-for-agents/) - action contracts, result envelopes, and error codes
- [Execution Model](https://docs.clawperator.com/reference/execution-model/) - required fields, timeout policy, and status semantics
- [Operator Automation Playbook](https://docs.clawperator.com/design/operator-llm-playbook/) - background runtime conventions and deeper rationale
- [llms.txt](https://clawperator.com/llms.txt) - root machine-readable index
- [llms-full.txt](https://clawperator.com/llms-full.txt) - full compiled technical corpus in one fetch
