# Clawperator Skill Design

Product naming:

- Product: `Clawperator`
- Legacy Android module/package naming in current codebase: `ActionTask` (temporary during migration)
- Repository rename planned: TBD

## Purpose

Define a deterministic, open-source **skill package** format for Android automation guidance.

Skills are the primary artifact for agents and humans.

For the recording-to-skill workflow and the normalization rules that turn a
raw capture into a reusable skill, see [Skill Authoring from
Recordings](../skills/skill-from-recording.md).

Each skill may include:
- `SKILL.md` (canonical agent-facing interface)
- `scripts/` (deterministic wrappers)
- `artifacts/*.recipe.json` (optional deterministic execution templates)

Implementation language preference for `scripts/`:

1. Node.js/TypeScript is the default for new non-trivial skills.
2. Bash should be limited to small wrappers and command orchestration.
   Any non-trivial Bash skill is a temporary exception and must include a top-of-file migration note indicating it is queued for Node.js/TypeScript migration.
3. Python is supported as a future secondary option once a Python SDK contract is defined.

Practical note:

- Even accurate automations are inherently fuzzy because user/account UI state varies (feature flags, rollout state, number of devices, personalization).
- Skills should encode preferred strategy plus fallbacks, not brittle assumptions.

Important scope boundary:

- Skill artifacts are accelerators, not a hard dependency.
- Clawperator must remain useful when a skill artifact is missing, stale, or incorrect.
- Runtime execution APIs must support direct execution without prebuilt artifacts.

## Concept Model

Recipe artifact semantics (inside a skill) are split into three explicit layers:

1. `probe`
   - Single observation/read operation.
   - No side effects.
   - Typical shape: `snapshot_ui` + `read_text` + parse.
2. `flow`
   - Multi-step procedure.
   - Navigation and reads, optionally side-effect free.
3. `action`
   - Side-effecting procedure (toggle/set/click-with-effect).
   - Must include verification after side effect.

Allowed `recipe_type` values (required):

- `probe`
- `flow`
- `action`

## Repository Ownership

Recommended split and source of truth:

1. Core repo:
   - Android runtime + Node CLI/API
   - skill/recipe schema and compiler
2. Skills repo (`clawperator-skills`):
   - versioned skill folders
   - optional deterministic `.recipe.json` artifacts per skill

Absence of a skill artifact must not block execution. It only removes compile assistance.

Suggested layout:

```text
skills/
  skills-registry.json
  skills-registry.schema.json
  generated/
    manifest.json
    skills-index.min.json
    skills-index.jsonl
    by-app/
      <application_id>.json
    by-prefix/
      <hash_prefix>.json
  tools/
    generate_skill_indexes.sh
  <application_id>.<intent>/
    SKILL.md
    skill.json
    scripts/
      *.ts | *.js | *.sh | *.py
    artifacts/
      *.recipe.json
```

Language policy for new skills:

- If the skill includes substantial parsing, state handling, retries, or multimodal outputs, implement in TypeScript.
- If the skill is a tiny launcher/wrapper, Bash is acceptable.
- Avoid introducing both Node and Python SDK dependencies at once; stabilize Node SDK/contracts first, then add Python based on demand.

## Recipe Artifact Schema

Implementation note:
- Current `skills/*/artifacts/*.recipe.json` files in this repository are runtime `AgentCommand` templates used by scripts/wrappers.
- The richer metadata schema below is the design target and is not yet enforced by the current artifact generator/runtime path.

Each optional recipe artifact remains deterministic and versioned.
If Markdown recipe files are used, they may start with YAML frontmatter.

Required fields:

- `recipe_id` (string, globally unique)
- `recipe_version` (semver)
- `recipe_type` (`probe|flow|action`)
- `application_id` (Android package id)
- `summary` (short purpose)
- `frameworks` (array from allowed taxonomy)
- `session_policy` (`fresh|resume_ok`)
- `app_build.version_name` (string)
- `app_build.version_code` (integer)
- `tested_on.android_api` (integer)
- `capabilities` (array from allowed capability set)
- `inputs` (array)
- `outputs` (array)

Recommended fields:

- `compatibility.min_version_code`
- `compatibility.max_version_code`
- `tested_on.device_model`
- `tested_on.locale`
- `tested_on.last_verified_at` (ISO-8601)
- `known_quirks`
- `failure_modes`
- `maintainers`
- `tags`
- `risk_level` (`low|medium|high`)

## Session Policy

`session_policy` is required.

- `fresh` (default)
  - Compiler auto-inserts step 0/1:
    - `close_app`
    - `open_app`
  - unless frontmatter sets `fresh_start_injected: false` and the recipe explicitly provides equivalent steps.
- `resume_ok`
  - compiler does not inject close/open.

This makes the reliability rule enforceable and uniform.

## PII and User-Specific Variable Policy

Canonical recipes must not contain user-specific literals.

Examples of forbidden literals in recipe files:

- personal names
- home/location labels
- device nicknames (for example a real AC tile label)
- physical device identifiers (for example real `adb` serials / `DEVICE_ID` values)
- account emails/addresses/phone numbers

Required approach:

1. User-specific/runtime-specific values must be declared in `inputs`.
2. Steps/selectors reference input variables, not hardcoded literals.
3. PII-like inputs must default to empty or generic placeholders, not real values.
4. Repositories should enforce a local sensitive-literal denylist via git hooks (`pre-commit` and/or `pre-push`) that scans staged diffs and blocks commits containing configured forbidden tokens.
5. Sensitive-literal scanning must include personal device serials/IDs used for local testing.

Local guardrail requirement:

- Keep denylist values in a local-only file that is never committed (for example under `.git/info/` or ignored local config).
- Hook output should identify offending file/line and fail with a clear remediation message.
- This is a complement to CI linting, not a replacement.

Example:

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: ac_tile_name
    type: string
    required: true
    default: ""
```

Compiler behavior:

- unresolved required variables fail compile deterministically (`RECIPE_INPUT_MISSING`).

## Framework Taxonomy

Allowed `frameworks` values:

- `views`
- `compose`
- `react-native`
- `expo`
- `flutter`
- `webview`
- `hybrid`
- `unknown`

## Capability Taxonomy

Required frontmatter field: `capabilities`.

Allowed values:

- `observe`
- `navigate`
- `click`
- `long_click`
- `enter_text`
- `toggle`
- `purchase_risk`

Node runtime uses this list for policy gating (allow/deny before execution).

## Deterministic Step Schema

Markdown remains human-readable, but each step must include a structured YAML block that maps 1:1 to runtime actions.

Example:

~~~md
## Step 3: Scroll to Devices

```yaml
id: scroll_devices
type: scroll_and_click
selector:
  text_contains: Devices
  annotation: STRUCTURAL
container:
  class: androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
wait:
  after_ms: 500
retries:
  count: 3
```
~~~

Required step block fields:

- `id` (unique within recipe)
- `type` (runtime action type)
- selector/matcher block required when action needs a target

Optional fields:

- `container`
- `wait`
- `retries`
- `confirm`
- `params`

## Selector DSL (v1)

Only these keys are allowed in selector blocks:

- `resource_id`
- `class`
- `text_equals`
- `text_contains`
- `content_desc_contains`
- `clickable`
- `enabled`
- `selected`
- `index_in_parent` (discouraged but allowed)
- `any_of`
- `all_of`
- `annotation`

`annotation` allowed values:

- `STRUCTURAL`
- `VARIABLE`
- `USER_SPECIFIC`
- `DERIVED`

Unknown selector keys are schema errors.

Variable interpolation rule:

- Selector text fields may use explicit variable placeholders only (for example `${inputs.ac_tile_name}`).
- Raw user-specific literal strings in selectors are schema/lint violations.

## Output Redaction

Each declared output field supports required redaction behavior:

- `redaction: none | hash | mask | drop`

Default policy:

- For text-derived outputs, default is `mask`.
- For non-text numeric state outputs, default is `none` unless overridden.

Example:

```yaml
outputs:
  - name: account_name
    type: string
    redaction: mask
  - name: battery_percent
    type: number
    redaction: none
```

## Runtime Mapping

Compiler may only emit supported runtime action types:

- `open_app`
- `close_app`
- `wait_for_node`
- `click`
- `scroll_and_click`
- `read_text`
- `snapshot_ui`
- `sleep`

Compilation must be deterministic and pure:

- no LLM reasoning at compile time
- no heuristics from prose-only sections
- identical input recipe + vars => identical execution output

## Validation Rules

Minimum validation checks:

1. Frontmatter required fields valid.
2. `recipe_type` and `frameworks` values valid.
3. `session_policy` present.
4. Every step has a valid YAML block.
5. Step action types are supported.
6. Selector DSL uses only allowed keys.
7. For `recipe_type=action` or capabilities containing `toggle|enter_text|purchase_risk`, a verification requirement must exist after each side-effecting step.
8. User-specific literals are not present in frontmatter, selectors, or step blocks.
9. Required input variables used by selectors are declared in `inputs`.

Verification can be satisfied by:

- explicit `confirm` block in the step, or
- subsequent `read_text`/assertion step referencing changed state.

## Fuzzy Real-World Variance (Cardinality Drift)

Skill artifacts must tolerate entity-count variance.

Example:

- artifact may prefer interacting with "second AC tile" when two units exist
- on another account only one unit may exist

Guidance:

1. Prefer selector intent over absolute index assumptions.
2. Treat index-based targeting as optional fallback, not primary strategy.
3. If preferred target cardinality is unavailable, emit a structured ambiguity/partial result and continue with best-effort navigation where safe.
4. Capture variance notes in `known_quirks`; avoid overfitting until real user data justifies tighter constraints.

## CI Requirements

`clawperator-skills` CI should run:

1. per-skill metadata validation (`skills/*/skill.json`)
2. run `skills/tools/generate_skill_indexes.sh`
3. `skills/skills-registry.json` schema validation
4. registry/index cross-check (every registered path exists and every skill folder is registered)
5. markdown parse + frontmatter schema validation
6. step schema validation
7. deterministic compile test
8. PII lint pass
9. capability policy lint (forbidden combos by profile)
10. literal-detector lint pass (fail on likely user-specific literals where variables are required)
11. compile-time input completeness checks for required variables

## Testing Strategy

Recipe/compiler and runtime behavior must be tested at multiple levels.

1. Unit tests (fast, deterministic)
   - frontmatter/schema parsing
   - selector DSL validation
   - variable interpolation
   - redaction behavior
   - compile determinism (`same input => same execution`)
2. Integration tests (mocked bridges)
   - compile + execution orchestration
   - alias normalization
   - error contracts (`RECIPE_INPUT_MISSING`, `VERIFY_FAILED`, etc.)
3. Android instrumentation tests (real device/emulator)
   - run generated executions end-to-end against live UI tree
   - verify result envelope format and correlation IDs
4. Real-device smoke tests (required in CI/nightly where available)
   - baseline known app flow (current practical baseline: Google Home)
   - detect major runtime regressions in selectors/waits/verification behavior
5. Future dedicated test APK
   - build a stable Android test app with known UI elements/states
   - use as canonical non-flaky contract suite for `click/read/wait/scroll/toggle`
