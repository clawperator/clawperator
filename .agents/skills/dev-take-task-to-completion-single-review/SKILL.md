# Dev Take Task to Completion - Single Review

Take the current implemented task to an up-to-date GitHub PR. Run task cleanup,
code simplification, local review, and PR creation in that order. Run one review-and-fix pass. This workflow is written for GPT-6 Astra.
It takes no arguments; infer the task from the current conversation and
repository. The review workflow is fixed.

Completion means the requested work and closeout changes are validated and
committed, the review stage has finished, and the PR contains the final
branch HEAD. Report a concrete blocker if any required stage cannot finish.

## Scope and Dependencies

Infer the task pack, implementation branch, acceptance criteria, and full change
scope from the current task and repository. Preserve unfinished phases of a
multi-PR pack. If implementation or required validation is incomplete, finish
the authorized scope before cleanup; do not expand into later phases.

Use the skills below, reading each when its stage is reached. Resolve shared
skills through the available skill catalog; the personal installation is
`~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. They are not assumed to exist in this repo.
If a required skill is unavailable, report the missing dependency rather than
silently replacing its workflow.

Invocation to complete this workflow authorizes its local edits, validation,
commits, implementation-branch push, and PR creation. Automatic discovery alone
does not grant that authorization. Preserve narrower user limits; do not merge
the PR, publish a release, force-push, or push directly to `main` or `prod`.

## Workflow

1. **Clean up the task.** Run [task-cleanup](../task-cleanup/SKILL.md).
   Preserve durable knowledge and actionable follow-up before retiring the
   completed pack or phases. If there is no task pack, record this stage as
   not applicable. Resolve an ambiguous pack before deleting anything.

2. **Simplify the implementation.** Run `$simplify-code` on the full task change,
   including cleanup changes, rather than only the latest commit. Preserve
   behavior, run affected checks, and commit justified changes under repository
   policy. No edits are needed when simplification would not improve the code.

3. **Review the completed change.** Prepare the branch for `$pr-create` before
   capturing the review target: ensure in-scope changes are committed, fetch
   `origin/main`, and merge it into the implementation branch if needed. Resolve
   conflicts and validate affected behavior. Do not switch away from unrelated
   work or silently include it. If the current branch is `main` or `prod`,
   establish a task branch containing the intended changes before proceeding.

   Run `$pr-code-review-codex` for one fresh, read-only GPT-6 Astra subagent
   review of the full branch change against a stable resolved base. The calling
   agent fixes and validates confirmed issues.

   Accept `CLEAN` or `FIXES_APPLIED` after required validation and commits.
   For `FIXES_APPLIED`, retain the reviewed HEAD and final HEAD and report that
   the fixes have not received a fresh review. Do not start a review-until-clean
   loop merely because this pass applied fixes.
   `RETRY_REQUIRED` needs a fresh review of the stable target. `BLOCKED` or
   incomplete validation stops PR creation; report the unfinished work.

4. **Create the PR.** Run `$pr-create`, using branch-total context to author its
   required title/body JSON. Include meaningful validation and the actual
   review outcome in the PR description. Resolve routine local prerequisites
   and rerun the skill instead of treating its preflight stop as completion.

   If its fresh fetch requires another merge, validate the resulting changes
   and run a fresh single review pass before pushing. Other changes after the
   accepted outcome also require validation and a fresh single pass; the review
   skill's own validated fixes are already covered by `FIXES_APPLIED`. If the
   comparison base changes, explicitly establish the updated full-branch scope
   for the new review.

   Push the final branch HEAD even when an upstream already exists. If the
   branch already has a PR, update that PR to describe the final scope rather
   than creating a duplicate. Verify its head commit matches local HEAD and
   return its URL. A failed push or PR operation leaves the workflow incomplete.

## Finish

Report cleanup and preserved follow-up, simplifications, validation, review
outcome, final commit, and PR URL. Distinguish a clean review from a
single pass with fixes applied. Keep the summary concise and identify any
unfinished stage without claiming completion.
