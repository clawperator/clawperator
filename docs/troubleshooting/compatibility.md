# Version Compatibility

**Current release: [0.5.2](https://github.com/clawperator/clawperator/releases/tag/v0.5.2)**

*This is the latest published release. Download URLs below reference this version. See [Docs Home](../index.md) for the unreleased code version.*

## Purpose

Define how the CLI checks compatibility with the installed Operator APK, what counts as compatible, which errors can be returned, and how to recover when versions do not align.

## Sources

- Compatibility probe: `apps/node/src/domain/version/compatibility.ts`
- Doctor readiness check: `apps/node/src/domain/doctor/checks/readinessChecks.ts`
- Error codes: `apps/node/src/contracts/errors.ts`

## Compatibility Rule

Current compatibility is exact normalized version equality between:

- CLI version from `package.json`
- installed APK `versionName` from `adb shell dumpsys package <operatorPackage>`

Normalization rule:

- versions are trimmed and any trailing `-d` is removed before comparison

Examples:

| CLI | APK | Compatible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0.1.0` | `0.1.0` | yes |
| `0.1.0-d` | `0.1.0` | yes |
| `0.1.1` | `0.1.0` | no |

The accepted parse format after normalization is the literal regex:

```text
^(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)$
```

## How Compatibility Is Checked

Doctor uses the readiness check id:

```text
readiness.version.compatibility
```

That check calls `probeVersionCompatibility()` and converts the result into a `DoctorCheckResult`.

Passing doctor example:

```json
{
  "id": "readiness.version.compatibility",
  "status": "pass",
  "summary": "CLI 0.1.0 is compatible with installed APK 0.1.0.",
  "evidence": {
    "cliVersion": "0.1.0",
    "apkVersion": "0.1.0",
    "apkVersionCode": 1,
    "operatorPackage": "com.clawperator.operator.dev"
  }
}
```

Failing doctor example:

```json
{
  "id": "readiness.version.compatibility",
  "status": "fail",
  "code": "VERSION_INCOMPATIBLE",
  "summary": "CLI and installed APK versions are not compatible.",
  "detail": "CLI version 0.1.1 is not compatible with installed APK version 0.1.0.",
  "evidence": {
    "cliVersion": "0.1.1",
    "apkVersion": "0.1.0",
    "operatorPackage": "com.clawperator.operator"
  }
}
```

Direct CLI compatibility checks use `clawperator version --check-compat --json` and return a top-level probe result:

```bash
clawperator version --check-compat --json --device <device_serial> --operator-package com.clawperator.operator.dev
```

Compatible response:

```json
{
  "cliVersion": "0.1.0",
  "apkVersion": "0.1.0",
  "apkVersionCode": 1,
  "operatorPackage": "com.clawperator.operator.dev",
  "compatible": true
}
```

Incompatible response:

```json
{
  "cliVersion": "0.1.1",
  "apkVersion": "0.1.0",
  "apkVersionCode": 1,
  "operatorPackage": "com.clawperator.operator",
  "compatible": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VERSION_INCOMPATIBLE",
    "message": "CLI 0.1.1 is not compatible with installed APK 0.1.0.",
    "hint": "Clawperator requires the exact same version between the CLI and APK, ignoring only the debug suffix."
  },
  "remediation": [
    "Download the matching APK: https://downloads.clawperator.com/operator/v0.5.2/operator-v0.5.2.apk",
    "Download the checksum: https://downloads.clawperator.com/operator/v0.5.2/operator-v0.5.2.apk.sha256",
    "Verify the checksum: sha256sum -c operator-v0.5.2.apk.sha256",
    "Install the matching APK: clawperator operator setup --apk operator-v0.5.2.apk --device <device_id>",
    "If you are using the release package, the versioned download above is the exact APK to install."
  ]
}
```

## Version Probing Flow

`probeVersionCompatibility()` performs these checks:

1. read CLI version from package metadata
2. parse the CLI version using the strict `x.y.z` compatibility regex after normalization
3. confirm the requested Operator package is installed
4. if the requested package is missing, check whether the alternate known variant is installed
5. read installed package info via adb
6. parse `versionName` and optional `versionCode`
7. compare normalized CLI and APK versions

Important consequences:

- compatibility is not "same major version" or "same minor version"
- it is exact normalized equality

## Verification Pattern

Use both surfaces when diagnosing version state:

```bash
clawperator version --check-compat --json --device <device_serial> --operator-package <package>
clawperator doctor --json --device <device_serial> --operator-package <package>
```

Check:

- `compatible` from `version --check-compat`
- `error.code` and `remediation` from `version --check-compat` when `compatible` is `false`
- the doctor check with `id == "readiness.version.compatibility"`
- `criticalOk` from doctor, because compatibility is a critical readiness check

## Error Codes

These are the compatibility-specific codes currently returned from this flow:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `VERSION_INCOMPATIBLE` | CLI and installed APK versions do not match after normalization |
| `APK_VERSION_UNREADABLE` | package metadata could not provide `versionName` |
| `APK_VERSION_INVALID` | APK version string exists but is not parseable as compatibility version |
| `CLI_VERSION_INVALID` | CLI version metadata is missing or not parseable |

Other closely related codes that may block compatibility checks before version comparison:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `OPERATOR_NOT_INSTALLED` | expected package is not installed |
| `OPERATOR_VARIANT_MISMATCH` | the other known package variant is installed instead |
| `DEVICE_SHELL_UNAVAILABLE` | adb shell could not read package state |

## Parse Rules

The accepted compatibility format is:

```text
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

Examples:

- valid: `0.1.0`
- valid after normalization: `0.1.0-d`
- invalid: `main`
- invalid: `0.1`

Exact normalization examples:

- `0.1.0-d` normalizes to `0.1.0`
- `0.1.0` stays `0.1.0`
- `0.1.0-debug` is invalid because only the trailing `-d` suffix is stripped

## Recovery

### When versions are incompatible

The probe returns remediation guidance to align CLI and APK versions.

Typical recovery options:

1. reinstall the CLI
2. install the matching APK version
3. for debug package workflows, rebuild and reinstall the debug APK from the same checkout

Release install path:

- download the version-matched APK URL generated from the CLI version
- download the matching sha256 URL
- install with `clawperator operator setup --apk ...`
- if you are targeting `com.clawperator.operator.dev`, include `--operator-package com.clawperator.operator.dev` on local install commands that need to target the debug package explicitly

The generated release URLs are exact:

- download: `https://downloads.clawperator.com/operator/v<version>/operator-v<version>.apk`
- checksum: `https://downloads.clawperator.com/operator/v<version>/operator-v<version>.apk.sha256`

### When the wrong variant is installed

If the debug package is installed but the release package was requested, or vice versa:

- pass the installed package via `--operator-package`
- or reinstall the intended variant

### When CLI metadata is invalid

If `CLI_VERSION_INVALID` occurs:

- reinstall the CLI package

Concrete failure shapes:

```json
{
  "code": "CLI_VERSION_INVALID",
  "message": "CLI version metadata is missing or unreadable."
}
```

```json
{
  "code": "CLI_VERSION_INVALID",
  "message": "CLI version main is not parseable for compatibility checks."
}
```

### When APK metadata is unreadable or invalid

If `APK_VERSION_UNREADABLE` or `APK_VERSION_INVALID` occurs:

- reinstall the Operator APK
- rerun `clawperator doctor --json`

Concrete failure shapes:

```json
{
  "code": "APK_VERSION_UNREADABLE",
  "message": "Could not find version metadata for com.clawperator.operator.dev in dumpsys output."
}
```

```json
{
  "code": "APK_VERSION_INVALID",
  "message": "Installed APK version main is not parseable for compatibility checks."
}
```

### When adb shell access is unavailable

If `DEVICE_SHELL_UNAVAILABLE` occurs:

- verify the device is still connected and authorized in `clawperator devices --json`
- confirm adb shell works directly with `adb -s <device_serial> shell true`
- rerun `clawperator doctor --json --device <device_serial> --operator-package <package>`

This code blocks compatibility probing before version metadata can be read from the device.

## Machine-Checkable Success Condition

Treat compatibility as healthy only when:

- `readiness.version.compatibility.status == "pass"`
- or `clawperator version --check-compat --json` shows `compatible: true`

Do not infer compatibility from app presence alone.
