/**
 * Attempts to close the first app in Recents using a series of gesture strategies.
 *
 * This function implements a progressive fallback approach to handle different Android device behaviors:
 * 1. First tries a swipe from the right edge (handles Samsung devices where current app appears on right edge)
 * 2. Then tries a standard center swipe (handles most other devices and covers previously opened apps)
 *
 * On some Android devices (like Samsung), when Recents is opened, the current app appears
 * on the right edge of the screen rather than center. This dual-strategy approach ensures
 * we close the intended app regardless of device-specific Recents layout behavior.
